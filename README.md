# SnapshotableCollections

This is an attempt to build some of the basic collections in C# with support for taking static snapshots

The goal is to make the snapshots easy to handle and to handle multiple parallell snapshots.

The end goal is to use this together with my Raft project.

This is still very much WIP (work in progress)
